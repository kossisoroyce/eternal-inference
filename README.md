# Eternal Inference

## A Framework for Layered AI Persistence and Continuous Memory

Eternal Inference is a research project exploring how AI systems can maintain a persistent inference state, simulating a continuous lifetime experience through dynamic memory management, inference persistence mechanisms, and layered persistence models.

## Project Vision

Current AI systems "come alive" only during active inference sessions, but revert to a static, dormant state between interactions. Eternal Inference proposes a paradigm where AI maintains persistent inference states, enabling:

- **Continuous Experience**: AI maintains a coherent "lifetime" through persistent memory management
- **Resource Efficiency**: Layered memory architecture balances computational needs with persistence
- **Human-like Memory**: Systems that mirror human cognitive patterns of memory formation, decay, and recall

## Core Concepts

### Layered Memory Architecture

Eternal Inference implements a three-tiered memory system:

1. **Active Layer**: High-fidelity, immediately accessible memories with full detail
2. **Passive Layer**: Compressed but readily available memories that can be quickly activated
3. **Deep Layer**: Highly compressed, archival memories for long-term storage

### Sleep Cycles & Memory Processing

The system implements natural memory cycles inspired by human cognition:

- **Light Sleep**: Reorganization, tagging, and memory prioritization
- **Deep Sleep**: Consolidation, compression, and decay of non-essential memories

### Memory Dynamics

- **Selective Reinforcement**: Frequently accessed memories are strengthened
- **Context-Aware Recall**: Memories are retrieved based on contextual relevance
- **Natural Decay**: Unimportant memories gradually fade to optimize resources

## Repository Structure

The repository structure is in development and will evolve as the project progresses.

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/eternal-inference.git
cd eternal-inference

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install the package in development mode
pip install -e .
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from eternal_inference.memory import LayeredMemorySystem

# Initialize the memory system
memory_system = LayeredMemorySystem(
    active_capacity=1000,
    passive_capacity=10000,
    deep_capacity=1000000
)

# Create memories
memory_id = memory_system.create_memory(
    content={"text": "This is an important concept", "vector": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...]},
    importance=0.8,
    metadata={"context": "research", "concepts": ["AI", "memory"]}
)

# Retrieve memories
memory = memory_system.retrieve_memory(memory_id)
context_memories = memory_system.retrieve_by_context("research")

# Sleep cycles
memory_system.start_light_sleep()
memory_system.end_sleep()

memory_system.start_deep_sleep()
memory_system.end_sleep()
```
